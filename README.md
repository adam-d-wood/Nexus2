Neuxs is a two-player, abstract strategy game. To use some more fancy words, it is a sequential, perfect information game, ie. players take turns and they know the entire state of the board. So yes, it's just what you might consider a 'normal' game like Chess or Go.

The project is still in its infancy but you can play against the program, or get it to play itself, in a 'playground' environment at [nexus.adamwood.co.uk](https://nexus.adamwood.co.uk).

An info page detailing the rules of the game is currently in production.

The long term plan is to add online functionality
